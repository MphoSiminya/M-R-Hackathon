Injection Challenge
### Bug one: The timeout was causing anything stored in local storage to be lost and and when you refresh, it keeps timing out, the informationn of the tasks being created as the user goes.
### Bug two: the renderTask() function needs to be uncommented out so that when the tasks are filtered using the filter function, the results show; as it stands, they are not being loaded once the filtering is done.
### Bug three: was a browser dependency
